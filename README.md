# dwm: yet another "my own build"

### About this repo  

Well, you all know what dwm is, so I believe, no need to explain. If that's not true - visit [dwm main page](https://dwm.suckless.org) first  
This build based on vanilla ```dwm 6.4```. I've applied quite a few patches listed below. Some of them was modified for my needs. 

* activetagindicatorbar
* attachx
* center
* cfacts
* dragcfacts
* cool-autostart
* cyclelayouts
* dragmfact
* focusdir
* focusonnetactive
* fullscreen-compilation
* ipc
* pertag
* placedir
* placemouse
* scratchpad
* steam
* switchtag
* tabbed_fickering_after_xdotool_windowreparent_workaround
* tagicons
* vanity gaps

Inspiration and code was taken from those repositories:
* https://github.com/bakkeby/patches/tree/master/dwm
* https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/dwm
* https://github.com/juacq97/dwm

Pretty sure, where was another, but I didn't remember :(

*Someday there will be screenshots and proper description for shortcuts and stuff, but not today*
